From there we can compare countires who win the most medals with countries that do not have a history of medal placement. We will also find dates and times of significant world events that we believe will impact athletic performance, and analyze the performance of those athletes over the time period of interest. We will attempt to separate these factors from pure athletic improvements by measuring average improvement in sports over time. We will then analyze deviations from the standard improvement metric which hopefully can be explained by the external factors we find.\n",

We will attempt to account for all factors we can think of, and look for data that may possibly explain these changes.

Perhaps, if the Olympic Committee were to realize that there are significant deviations in athletic performance during times of war, they will cancel the Olympic games in times of conflict. Or perhaps if significant technological changes are shown to create large disparities between developed and developing countries in Olympic performance, the Committee will limit the amount countries can spend on their athletes in the Olympic Games.
